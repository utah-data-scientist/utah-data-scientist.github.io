      <description>General advice Keep in mind as you do online research (including here) that there is no one ordained way to get in the field. There is a plethora of sources out there, and as you scour keep in mind this principle (borrowing from Tolstoy):
 &amp;ldquo;All [successfull approaches to getting into data science] are alike; each [unsuccessful approach to getting into data science] is [unsuccessful] in its own way.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>You may not know about Branded Entertainment Network but you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen their work in many shows and influencer content and didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice it. That&amp;rsquo;s because they use AI to seamlessly integrate brands into TV, movies and other media. Check out their website &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool stuff!

      <description>The data team at AdvancedMD just had its first birthday a few months ago. Last year, the leadership decided it was time to invest in their data strategy by creating a data team with two analysts, a data scientist and a data engineer. Since then, they have revolutionized how data is accessed and used throughout the company. I spoke with Dallin Homer, the Business Analytics and Insights Manager over the data team, about how data science is done at AdvancedMD and any advice he had for those getting started in the field.</description>

      <description>About After going through starting my data science career in Utah and talking to people interested in getting into data science but not knowing how, I decided to put up this website to help.
This site isn&amp;rsquo;t about teaching you how to do data science &amp;ndash; there are plenty of those out there (Kaggle, YouTube, a million blogs). This site is different because you get to learn about what the workplaces are like here, what tools the teams use and the skills they value to help guide you on your quest into data science.</description>
