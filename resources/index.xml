      <description>General advice Keep in mind as you do online research (including here) that there is no one ordained way to get in the field. There is a plethora of sources out there, and as you scour keep in mind this principle (borrowing from Tolstoy):
 &amp;ldquo;All [successfull approaches to getting into data science] are alike; each [unsuccessful approach to getting into data science] is [unsuccessful] in its own way.&amp;rdquo;</description>

Résumé  https://will-stanton.com/creating-a-great-data-science-resume/  Blog / online portfolio  This is not a data science blog portfolio but a nice example of an &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo; page if you need some inspiration.  Preparing for Coding interviews This is a mix of interactive exercises, PDFs and blogs to help you prep for that interview.
