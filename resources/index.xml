General advice Keep in mind as you do online research (including here) that there is no one ordained way to get in the field. There is a plethora of sources out there, and as you scour keep in mind this principle (borrowing from Tolstoy):
 &amp;ldquo;All [successfull approaches to getting into data science] are alike; each [unsuccessful approach to getting into data science] is [unsuccesful] in its own way.</description>

Getting Setup with R R is a statistical programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s open-source and used widely across different industries for finance, statistics, bioinformatics, natural language processing (NLP), making sharable apps called Shiny apps, and that&amp;rsquo;s just a few examples.
There are thousands of blogs and tutorials you could read, but we recommend starting by installing R and RStudio on your machine. Then you can follow along and practice and start developing code and apps.</description>

Newsletters  Data Science Weekly Newsletter Python Weekly Newsletter Data Elixir Newsletter  Twitter Twitter helped me so much in my early days. It was like being in a bunch of interesting conferences all at the same time and hearing what people were talking about in the community. I found some great tutorials that sparked my interest in programming and the rest is history.
Again, by no means is this list complete, but it&amp;rsquo;s a great starting point of people to follow to build up your feed</description>
